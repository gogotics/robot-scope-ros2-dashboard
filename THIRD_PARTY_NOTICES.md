## External runtime components

Unitree ROS 2, Hesai drivers, FAST-LIO, Livox SDK2, Livox message packages and
Nav2 are not vendored by this repository. If they are bundled into an
installation image or redistributed with Robot Scope, the distributor must
inventory and comply with their licenses and NOTICE requirements separately. See
[`docs/DEPENDENCIES.md`](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md).

The pinned bootstrap manifest currently identifies Unitree ROS 2 and Hesai ROS
2 as BSD-3-Clause, Livox SDK2 and Livox ROS driver 2 as MIT, and FAST-LIO as
GPL-2.0-only. Those projects are downloaded and built only when the operator
requests it; they are not relicensed by Robot Scope's MIT license. Redistributors
of a full system image must review the exact pinned sources and satisfy all
applicable source, license and notice obligations.
